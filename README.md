## Patient Clinical Trial Test Prediction Project_with_MLflow

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict patient risk while conducting for clinical trials. Predicting patient risk is crucial to ensure efficient and fair selection of drugs for further usage based on their effects, chemical composition, and other relevant factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to accurately determine the likelihood of a patient risk while conducting clinical trials.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop robust classification models that accurately predict patient risk for clinical trials. These models will assist medical researchers and healthcare professionals in evaluating patient applications, thereby enhancing decision-making processes and improving clinical trial efficiency.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing relevant attributes such as patient demographics, medical history, test results, and other clinical trial eligibility criteria. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Machine learning algorithms and techniques explored in this project include:

- MultiOutputClassifier

### Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models.
